Kernel tagging:
- The GIT tree is here: https://github.com/nemomobile/kernel-adaptation-n950-n9
- The branch for 2.6.32 based development is "mer-n9-2.6.32-20121301"
- The old nemo-n9-2.6.32.YYYYDDMM.X tag numbering is not sequential, so we
  increase the version during 2012 by just incrementing the .X, YYYYDDMM
  has to remain same to make sure versions increase and zypper does not get
  confused.

- Once we reach 2013, the tagging will be changed to
  nemo-n9-2.6.32.YYYYMMDD.X, where YYYYMMDD is the date, and X is running
  number starting from 1 for tags made during same day.

The kernel tarball generation (using git-archive):

git archive --format=tar --prefix=kernel-n9-2.6.32.YYYYMMDD.X/ nemo-n9-2.6.32.YYYYMMDD.X |bzip2 > kernel-n9-2.6.32.YYYYMMDD.X.tar.bz2

Spec file generation:
- Generate spec files from kernel-adaptation-n950.spec.tpl using generate-spec.sh. 
- Remember to edit EXTRAVERSION in generate-spec.sh, if you tagged a new version.
